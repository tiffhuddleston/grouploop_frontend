## Project Description

GroupLoop is a social media grouping site where the user will join circles where they can keep up with the other members across social media platforms, like a scrapbook of experiences with people or a yearbook for the digital age. Great for book clubs, workshop or bootcamp attendees, or to keep a list of people of interest in your professional or leisure field.
